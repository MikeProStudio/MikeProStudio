# Hi there, I'm Michael! 👋

Technical enthusiast focused on **IoT Development** and **FPV Systems**. 
I love bridging the gap between hardware and software.

### 2. What I'm working on:
- 🛠️ **IoT & Embedded:** Building devices with nRF52 (Zephyr RTOS), ESP32-S3 and other SoC with Wireless Interfaces.
- 🛸 **FPV Tech:** Custom builds, PID tuning, and long-range GPS configurations.
- 💻 **Software:** Firmware development (C/C++) and Python scripting.

### 🔧 Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** C, C++, Python
- **Platforms:** Zephyr RTOS, ESP-IDF, Arduino
- **Hardware:** BLE-Coded PHY, AMOLED Integration, GPS Modules

### 🎥 Beyond the Code:
When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the gym or out in the field chasing cinematic shots with my FPV drones.
